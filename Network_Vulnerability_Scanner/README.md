# Title: Network Vulnerability Scanner
`![Scanner Demonstration](demonstration.png)`

## 📖 Description:
A multi threaded network scanner coded in Python. It scans for open ports, then finds running services by attempting to grab a banner and finally, cross checks with the local Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) database based of the official NIST CVE database.

## 📂 Project Structure:
* `scanner.py`: This handles all main functions of the server including socket connections, thread management and the user interface.
* `CVE_db.py`: The CVE local database used for this project. Specific service banners are mapped to their CVE id, severity, score and description. Feel free to add more.

## ⚡ How to Run
1. Clone the repo.
2. Run 'python3 scanner.py' on your local device.

## ⚙️ How It Works
* **Part 1:** Using the socket library initiate a TCP connection by attempting a 3 way handshake to see if a port is open or not. 
* **Part 2:** Attempt to grab banner to find the specific software running on the open port.
* **Part 3:** Grabbed banner is cross referenced with the local CVE database.
* **Part 4:** Threads are concurrently spawned to scan the entire target range simultaneously.

## 🧠 Learning Points
* **Two sides of CVEs**: I discovered the public NIST database and it made me think how it could be used for both bad and good. Defenders can use it to easily see what should be patched but attackers can use this information to detect attack surfaces. 
* **TCP Handshake**: Seeing the TCP handshake in action via my code was really cool. The abstract concept of sending the SYN packet and waiting to see if a SYN-ACK is returned was cool, especially to see it using to see potential vulnerabilities through open ports. 
* **Banners**: I learnt that some services immediately send information about their identity through banners. I also found it interesting that only some services do it but like some don't e.g. 
* **Threading**: I learnt threading in university but implementing it my scanner made me understand how it could be applied in real life. Applying theory to a real security tool helped me learn faster than just reading it about it. 

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This project is only for educational use that I created for authorised security testing and portfolio demonstration. It is ILLEGAL to scan networks without explicit permission so please be careful. I do not take responsibility for misuse.
