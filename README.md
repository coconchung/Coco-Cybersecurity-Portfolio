# Hi, I'm Coco! 👋

## 🚀 About Me
**Learning should be loud.**

Listening to lecturers for hours on end didn't really work for me. Nothing stuck. It was only when I started translating those technical notes into my own words that things made sense.

I realised I wasn't the only one struggling with confusing topics, so I decided to document the journey online. **By my 4th video, I hit 20k views in a single day.** Turning super hard concepts into short videos wasn't just helping me master them; it was helping people around the world.

**That human connection is why I chose this industry.**

I believe Cybersecurity is a **human problem**, not just a computer one. I am fascinated by the psychology of security and love how this field changes every day. Solving the puzzle requires understanding people just as much as understanding the technicalities.

🚀 **I am currently looking for a Cybersecurity Graduate Role where I can put this curiosity to work!**
